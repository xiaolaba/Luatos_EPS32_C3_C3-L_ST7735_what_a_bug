# Luatos_EPS32_C3_C3-L_ST7735_what_a_bug
Luatos core-esp32c3 and core-esp32c3L, very different response by LCD ST7735

tested with a few LCD ST7735 libray, but no luck.  

there are two different board manufactured by Luatos

the code, the same, the buring flash process the same, one is working and the other hang on reboot, did not work. buy why was that ?
